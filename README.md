Solution for Problem C (Data Insights) in the 2024 [Mathematical Contest in Modeling](https://www.contest.comap.com/undergraduate/contests/mcm/). 

Broadly, the problem was about tennis games and the concept of "momentum" in sports. Teams used 2023 Wimbledon men's singles data to:
- Develop a model and visualization for the flow of play in a tennis match. The model identifies which player is performing better at a given time in a match, as well as how much better they are performing.
- Assess the role of momentum in a match and determine if swings in performance are random.
- Identify indicators and develop a model to predict performance swings.
